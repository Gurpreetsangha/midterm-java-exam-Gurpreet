Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.
--> Data structure is the way where we easily organize the data and retrieve the data. with data structure easily handle
    maintaining information, retrieving information, inputting information, processing information.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
--> the various operation performed by the dat structure is:-
    insertion
    deletion
    traverse
    searching
    sorting

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
-->
what is an Array?
--> Array is used to store the multiple similar type of values in a single variable.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
-->Array:- array is static.
           array size is fixed
           it can hold similar type data values.
           we can use for and for each loop for iterate over an array.

   ArrayList:- ArrayList is dynamic.
               size is not fixed.
               it is class of java collection
               we can use iterator for iterate over an array.

what is LinkedList?
--> LinkedList is a class of java collection. which can contain many object of the same type.
     linkedList contain the duplicate values.it maintain the insertion order. and it's not synchronized.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
--> Array:- Array store the value in continues memory zone.
            store element is not depend on each other.
            memory is assign on compile time.

   LinkedList:- store element randomly.
                stored element dependent on each other.
                memory is assign on run time.
what is queue?
--> A queue is define as a linear data structure that is open at both end and operation are performed first in
    first out(FIFO) order.

what is stack?
--> A stack is linear data structure and operation is performed in last in first out (LIFO) order.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
--> FIFO:- is first in first out example is Queue
    LIFO:- is last in first out example is stack.

what is the order of complexity?
--> constant complexity
    logarithm complexity
    linear complexity

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
-->
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
--> worst case is complexity in binary search.

what is tree in data structure?
--> tree data structure is a hierarchical data structure and collection of element known as a nodes.

what is graph in data structure?
-->graph in data structure is collection of nodes that have data and they are connected to each other.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
--> HashTable:- hashtable does not allow any null key and null value.
                hashtable is synchronize and thread safe.
    HashMap  :-HashMap allow one null key and multiple null values.
               hashmap is not synchronized and not thread safe.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
--> RDBMS used Array
    Network data model use -- Graph
    Hierarchical data model use-- Trees

How HashMap works in java?
--> HashMap store the data in key and value pair. But in internal process HashMap using  hashcode() and equals() methods
    for storage hashmap use bucket.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
--> ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a exception in java. it is occurs whenever we are trying to access any item
    of an array at an index which is not present in the array. or when we exceed the size of array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
--->
    copy Array using assignment operator
    Loop to copy array
    copyOfRange() java method

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
--> Array:- Array store the value in continues memory zone.
            store element is not depend on each other.
            memory is assign on compile time.

   LinkedList:- store element randomly.
                stored element dependent on each other.
                memory is assign on run time.

What is DFS and BFS?
--> DEF:- stands for Depth First Search. in DFS traversal stack data structure is used its based on last in first out
          principal.
   BFS :- stands for Breadth first search. in BFS traversal queue data structure is used.its based on first in last out.

What is Recursion?
--> Recursion is a process in which is a function call itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and
    the corresponding function is called a recursion functions.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
--> Linear data structure is a structure in which the elements are stored in sequentially and elements are
    connected to previous and next element.data element can traversed or accessed in a single run

    Non linear:- data structure is a also another type od structure in which element are not arranged in a sequential
     meaner its called non sequential data structure. data element can not traversed or accessed in a single run.

     What is Big-(O)-annotation?
     --> The Big-O notation is a notation made for showing computer algorithm performance, when the input is very large.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
--> Bubble sort
    selection sort
    insertion sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
